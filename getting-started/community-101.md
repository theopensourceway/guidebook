# Community 101
This chapter is named _Community 101_ in reference to a way of numbering courses at colleges and universities. The "101 course" is the material you first encounter as a learner in a specific field.

There are generally two pursuit areas where it comes to getting involved in open source software from the very beginning. The first pursuit ranges from understanding through to participating in an existing open source community. The second pursuit is deciding to start a new open source software community yourselves.

This chapter is in two sub-sections. The first covers pursuit toward participation. The second covers how you decide if you want to start a new open source community.

## Understanding the basics
If you are considering forming or joining an open source community for the first time, some of the concepts may be new. This section explains the basics of an open source community, and why people and organizations get involved in them.

### What is a community?
A community is a group of people united by a common identity and collective purpose who engage in activities together over time. Communities develop unique sets of shared values, principles, and norms that distinguish them from others and provide members with a sense of belonging.

### What is an open source software community?
An open source software community is a group of people united by the shared purpose of developing, maintaining, extending, and promoting a specific body of open source software. These communities are often globally distributed—their members occupy different geographic regions and work across numerous industries. What unites them is their common vision for the open source software project—as well as the spirit of camaraderie and collective identity that participating in the community affords them.

### What are upstream communities?
The community-driven ecosystem of open source software is vast and difficult to visualize, so many developers tend to describe it metaphorically, preferring the language of waterways and tributaries. Software that forms the foundation of other software is said to exist "upstream" from that software. When "upstream" software undergoes changes, those changes flow "downstream" to the open source projects that rely on them. When programmers working "downstream" create innovations that might benefit others, they can submit those changes "upstream" to their parent projects, so those improvements can ripple outward to everyone utilizing those same upstream projects.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux, for example, exists "downstream" from many open source software projects that comprise it, such as Fedora and CentOS Stream. Those projects, in turn, rely on additional "upstream" projects—like the Linux kernel, the GNOME desktop environment, and hundreds more.

### How does an open source software community form?
Open source software communities form when people agree to work together to build and improve software. For this to occur, a person or group building software must make that software available to others—by releasing the software's source code and expressly giving others permission to copy, modify, and redistribute it (typically under the terms of a specific open source license).

Because open source communities are globally distributed, they typically form online through the shared use of electronic mailing lists, forums like Discourse, and code-sharing platforms like GitHub.

### How does someone gets involved in an open source community?
Most open source software communities don't have formal membership applications or approval processes. More commonly, people get involved in projects simply by contributing to them in some way—for example, by fixing bugs in software code, creating new features for an application, writing and editing documentation, creating logos and graphics, promoting adoption of the software, representing the project at a conference and other events, or assisting others who have questions about the software.

In short, people earn membership in open source software communities by virtue of their contributions to those communities and the positive reputations they establish as a result of those contributions.

### Why do people join open source software communities?
People join open source software communities for many different reasons.

Many join because working on the software is part of their jobs—either because their organizations hired them to develop it, or because their jobs depend on the software working well. They join communities so they can directly impact the development of software on which they (or their organizations) rely for critical operations. Other people join because communities offer opportunities for them to sharpen their skills by working alongside and learning from others. Some join because doing so allows them to collaboratively solve a problem they're experiencing. Some join because of their belief in the importance of contributing to a common set of resources beneficial to everyone. And others join for the purpose of socializing, or for a sense of identity and affiliation.

### Why do organizations get involved in open source software communitities?
Organizations increasingly rely on open source software applications for various critical operations, as much of the world's most innovative and effective applications are open source. So they participate in open source software communities because they're invested in the long-term viability, stability, and security of those applications—and, often, because they want to influence development of those applications' features and functionalities.

Other organizations participate in open source software communities because they'd like the software they've developed to become an industry-wide standard—they open their work in the hope that others will more quickly adopt and integrate it.

Many organizations find that participating in open source software communities allows them to access a wider talent pool than they could if they developed their applications entirely in house.

### How can an organization can start participating in an open source software community?
Consider engaging an open source community using the same approach you might take when you move into a new neighborhood. Introduce yourself and work to understand the community's history, values, and dynamics before proposing big changes.

Make new friends by performing small jobs. Fix bugs in source code. Edit documentation. Build installation scripts. If your organization is able to allocate additional resources to support the community, consider sponsoring that community's activity at events or hiring community developers so they're able to spend more time working on the project.

Just note that arriving in a community with more people than it can comfortably welcome at one time may elicit a reaction from the community, which can be counterproductive to an organization's long-term goals. And choose your organization's initial participants in a community wisely. Individuals—not organizations—join open source communities, and the trust one participant garners is not automatically transferrable to another person or organization.

### How can companies who are market competitors participate in the same open source communities?
Many companies are in this position. These companies have determined that collaborating on mutually beneficial software applications or standards is more valuable than competing to develop different, perhaps incompatible, technologies. Instead, their business models involve building market-differentiating and revenue-generating innovations on top of these shared technological foundations.

### How does an organization determine whether to get involved in an open source software community?
Getting involved in an open source software community has important organizational, procedural, and legal implications for an enterprise. Most organizations that are seriously invested in open source software development fund internal open source program offices (OSPO) to advise the organization on matters related to open source community participation. Others partner with open source experts to advise this work.

## Considering forming a community
It is possible and not uncommon to have software that is open source and the maintainers have shown no interest in forming a community beyond themselves. Frankly, not every code base needs its own community. Conversely, any code base may suddenly find itself at the center of a community that arises around it. Being open source doesn't mean it must have a community. But it does mean that if it has one, it gets certain benefits particular to open source software.

Forming an open source software community has many of the same ethical and organizational considerations of forming any other community of practice. A community of practice is a group of people who share a common interest, who also get together to learn and practice within the common domain.

An example of a community of practice might be hammer dulcimer players who have an annual gathering to share about the art and practice of being a hammer dulcimer player. Or it might be skateboarders, gathering every week at the park to learn and practice new tricks.

For you and your organization to consider forming an open source software community, you must first ask yourselves: Are you willing to form and be the caretakers for any other sort of community? Does doing so match your vision? Does it match your style of getting things done?

For example, an organization like a university or a branch of the armed forces would have two very different approaches to getting things done. Their reasons for forming any kind of community may be wildly different, or unexpectedly aligned.

A feature of communities of practice that applies to open source software communities is how they can truly draw together people and organizations from wildly different worlds. Open source software communities, like all communities of practice, can truly draw people together from wildly different worlds. In open source communities, people with common interests (shared practices) band together to learn and grow collaboratively (community).

Some other considerations around forming an open source community:

* You are interested in the benefits of open collaboration and innovation. You might already have or are planning a new technology, and open source is a way to find like-minded collaborators. Or you may just have a feeling that this is the right approach for your plans.
* Attracting enthusiasts to your project is a key part of your growth strategy, and you've identified that open source contributors of all types are good enthusiasts for you.
* The scientific method is core to your mission, purpose, and/or practices, and you see the benefit of having your entire software toolchain, infrastructure, et al as something your users should be able to contribute to and become maintainers of.
* Your organization is one that is open, collaborative, and community-building by nature. You may create right-sized open source projects, where the users and contributors are closely aligned in some way. For example, collaborators at a university. If there is no legal barrier to starting a project, why not start one? You never know who might find it and benefit from it in the future.

## Conclusion
This chapter covered the basics of what an open source community is and why different types of people and organizations participate in them. Then it discussed considerations people make when determining whether to start a new open source community.
