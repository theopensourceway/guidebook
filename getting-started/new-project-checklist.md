# New Project Checklist

This is a relatively simple checklist for you to consider when starting a new open source project, especially where the project may be starting small but wants room to grow. By _simple_ we mean: this list doesn't propose a process or project management for accomplishing these items. In its most simple form it does not have definitions for items; it suggests what is to come without prescribing or demanding obedience to the list.

These are separated out into several different lists, depending on the area covered:

### Goals of project

* [ ] Technical problem addressed by the project
* [ ] Intended users and value proposition
* [ ] Establish beginning roadmap with milestones

### Market positioning

* [ ] List of related/similar projects
* [ ] Why a net-new project?
* [ ] Key differentiators

## Project name

* [ ] Compile and vet candidate list
* [ ] Logo design
* [ ] Legal review (if required)
* [ ] Reserve name (domain name, GitHub, social media handles, etc.)

## Licensing & legal

* [ ] Document license criteria
* [ ] License selection
* [ ] Need â„¢ or other mark registration?

## Governance

* [ ] Define officers & their responsibilities
* [ ] Org structure, voting reqs & process
* [ ] Rules for amending governance
* [ ] Rules for contribution, committer status
* [ ] Provisions for sub-projects and lifecycle management
* [ ] Privacy policy
* [ ] Code of conduct
* [ ] Foundation membership options, if planned

## Project infrastructure

* [ ] Mail tool (and moderators)
* [ ] Forum/Chat (and moderators)
* [ ] Doc repository (slides, planning docs, etc)
* [ ] Web conferencing platform
* [ ] Community calendar (tool + who will maintain)
* [ ] Public website and website maintenance
* [ ] CI/CD, development and test environments
* [ ] Lab requirements, how they will be acquired
* [ ] Code contribution tools and process
* [ ] Project documentation platform

## Ownership and financing

These items may be ignored if donating project assets to a foundation.

* [ ] Website URL
* [ ] Logo
* [ ] Social media handles
* [ ] Web conferencing platform (if paid)
* [ ] Process for funding project needs

## Launch planning

* [ ] D\&I plan
