== Why metrics are important in Open Source communities

=== Provide objective measures
=== Transparency: Know who is contributing and where contributions are happening (especially as project/community grows)
=== Encourage community participation: Are new contributors joining the community? Who are some of the regular contributors in the community? 
=== Identify potential bottlenecks in the community: Are bugs/issues being close in a reasonable timeframe? Are reviews happening in timely manner? 


== Choosing the right metrics for your community


== Developing metrics for your community

=== Take advantage of APIs, dashboards, plug-ins, etc. that are available in your software tools (e.g. forums, code repositories, issue trackers, wiki’s, etc.)
=== Resources/examples from other communities: Lot of communities have good documentation/code for their dashboards (e.g. CNCF, Ruby, etc.)  
=== The CHAOSS project (https://chaoss.community) develops metrics definition and sample implementation for open source communities. 

== Metrics pitfalls

=== Examples of poor uses of metrics (esp. in Open Source communities). 
=== Shortcomings of metrics


== Metrics dos and don'ts 

=== Dos: Make metric public; use metrics for spotting outliers; Metrics should be used for gaining further insight into community health.
=== Dont's: Using metrics as a sole basis for rewards; presenting metrics without proper context; ignoring non-metrics. 


== Parting thoughts, resources, etc. 
 
=== Your metrics should evolve with your community/Set of metrics you use should not be set in stone.
=== Remember to continue having hallway conversations with the community.
